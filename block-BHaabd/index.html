                     <p>Dogs, often hailed as humans’ best friends, have been the 
                        topic of many scientific studies looking into how they might boost 
                        our well-being.</p>

                        <p>According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), 
                            an estimated 78 million dogs are owned as pets in the United States.

                            It is unclear when dogs were first domesticated, but a studyTrusted Source published last year 
                            claims that, at least in Europe, dogs were tamed 20,000–40,000 years ago.</p>

                       <p> Dogs can strengthen our health not just as we 
                        grow older, but also much, much earlier than that: 
                        before we are even born.</p>
